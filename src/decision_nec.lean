# Decision procedure - necessary condition

We introduce a condition `decstr` and show that if a string `en` is `derivable`, then `decstr en`
holds.

Using this, we give a negative answer to the question: is `"MU"` derivable?

### Numerical condition on the `I count

Let `icount st` denote the number of `I`s in `st : miustr`. We'll show that the `icount` of a
derivable string must be 1 or 2 moduloe 3. To do this, it suffices to show that if the `miustr`
`en` is derived from `st`, then `icount en` moudulo 3 is either equal to or is twice `icount st`
modulo 3.
-/

/--
`icount` is the number of `I`s in an `miustr`
-/
def icount : miustr → ℕ
| [] := 0
| (I::cs) := 1 + icount cs
| (_::cs) := icount cs

/--
`icount` is additive with respect to `append` 
-/
lemma icountappend (a b : miustr) :
  icount (a ++ b) = icount a + icount b :=
begin
  induction a with x hx hxs, -- treat a as x :: xs in the inductive step
    simp [icount], -- trivial base case
    cases x; -- the same proof applies whether x = 'M', 'I', or 'U'
      simp [icount, hxs, add_assoc],
end

open nat

/--
Given `st en : miustr`, the relation `nice_imod3 st en` holds if `st` and `en` either
have equal `icount`, modulo 3, or `icount en` is twice `icount st`, modulo 3.`
 -/
def nice_imod3 (st en : miustr) : Prop :=
  let a := (icount st) in
  let b := (icount en) in
  b ≡ a [MOD 3] ∨ b ≡ 2*a [MOD 3]

example : nice_imod3 "II" "MIUI" :=
begin
  left, refl, -- icount "MIUI" ≡ icount "II" [MOD 3]
end

example : nice_imod3 "IUIM" "MI" :=
begin
  right, refl, --icount "MI" ≡ 2*(icount "IUIUM") [MOD 3]
end


/-  We show the icount, mod 3, stays the same or is multiplied by 2 under the rules of inference -/

/- Now we show that the icount of a derivable string is 1 or 2 modulo 3-/

-- We start with a general result about natural numbers.

lemma inheritmod3 {a b : ℕ} (h1 : a % 3 = 1 ∨ a % 3 = 2)
  (h2 : b % 3 = a % 3 ∨  b % 3 = (2 * a % 3)) :
    b % 3 = 1 ∨ b % 3 = 2 :=
begin
  cases h2, {
    rw h2, 
    exact h1,
  }, {
    cases h1, {
      right,
      simp [h2,mul_mod,h1],
      refl,
    }, {
      left,
      simp [h2,mul_mod,h1],
      refl,
    }
  }
end


/--
`inctder` shows any derivable string must have an `icount` that is 1 or 2 modulo 3.
-/
theorem icntder (en : miustr): derivable en → 
  (icount en) % 3 = 1 ∨ (icount en) % 3 = 2:=

      left, simp [icountappend,icount,refl],

Using the above theorem, we solve the MU puzzle, showing that `"MU"` is not derivable.

begin
  intro h,
  cases (icntder _ h);
    contradiction,
end

### Condition on `M`

That solves the MU puzzle, but we'll proceed by demonstrating the other necessary condition for a
string to be derivable, namely that the string must start with an M and contain no M in its tail.
-/


/--
`goodm xs` holds if `xs : miustr` begins with `M` and contains no `M` in its tail.
-/
def goodm (xs : miustr) : Prop :=
  ∃ ys : miustr, xs = (M::ys) ∧ ¬(M ∈ ys)

/- Example usage -/

lemma goodmi : goodm [M,I] :=
begin
  split,
    swap,
  exact [I],
  simp,
end

/-
We'll show, for each `i` from 1 to 4, that if `en` follows by rule `i` from `st` and if
`goodm st` holds, then so does `goodm en`.
