# Decision procedure - sufficient condition

We give a sufficient condition for a string to be derivable in the MIU language.

Let `icount st` and `ucount st` denote the number of `I`s (respectively `U`s) in `st : miustr`.

We'll show that an MIU string is `derivable` if it has the form `M::x` where `x` is a string of `I`s
and `U`s where `icount x` is congruent to 1 or 2 modulo 3.

To prove this, it suffices to be able to show that one can derive an `miustr` `M::y` where `y` is
an `miustr` consisting only of `I`s and where the number of `I`s in `y` is `a+3b` where
`a = icount x` and `b = ucount x`.
This suffices because Rule 3 permits us to change any string of three consecutive `I`s into a `U`.

Note `icount y = (icount x) + 3(ucount x) ≡ icount x [MOD 3]`. Thus, it suffices to show we can
generate any `miustr` `M::z` where `z` is an `miustr` of `I`s such that `icount z` is congruent to
1 or 2 modulo 3.

Let `z` be such an `miustr` and let `c` denote `icount z`, so `c ≡ 1 or 2 [MOD 3]`.
To derive such an `miustr`, it suffices to derive an `miustr` `M::w`, where again w is an
`miustr` of only `I`s with the additional conditions that `icount w` is a power of 2, that
`icount w ≥ c` and that `icount w ≡ c [MOD 3]`.

To see that this suffices, note that we can remove triples of `I`s from the end of `M::w`,
creating `U`s as we go along. Once the number of `I`s equals `m`, we just remove `U`s two at a time
until we have no `U`s. The only issue is that we may not have an even number of `U`s!
Writing `d = icount w`, we see that this happens if and only if `(d-c)/3` is odd.
To avoid this, we apply Rule 1 to `z` in this case, prior to removing triples of `I`s.
By applying Rule 1, we add an additional `U` so the final number of `U`s will be even.

## Converting `I`s to `U`s

For any given natural number `c ≡ 1 or 2 [MOD 3]`, we need to show that can derive an `miustr`
`M::w` where `w` consists only of `I`s,  where `d = icount w` is a power of 2, where `d ≥ c` and
where `d ≡ c [MOD 3]`.

Given the above lemmas, the desired result reduces to an arithmetic result, given in the file
`arithmetic.lean`.

We'll use this result to show we can derive an `miustr` of the form `M::z` where `z` is an string
consisting only of `I`s such that `icount z ≡ 1 or 2 [MOD 3]`.

As an intermediate step, we show that derive `z` from `zt`, where `t` is aN `miustr` consisting of
an even number of `U`s and `z` is any `miustr`.

### The main result

The remainder of this file sets up the proof that `derivable en` follows from `decstr en`.

The proof proceeds by induction on the `ucount` of `en`.

We tackle first the base case of the induction. This requires auxiliary results: one is a proof of
`icount ys ≤ length ys`. Two others give conditions under which  `icount ys = length ys`.
